## Summary of Actions
- Fixed search result navigation by creating proper endpoints for different entity types

- Implemented proper error handling and fallbacks

### 4. Fixed Search Navigation
- Enhanced `SearchModal.tsx` to properly handle search result clicks
- Added explicit handling for different entity types
- Ensured URL validation before navigation attempts

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

   - Fix NextJS warning about awaiting dynamic params in API routes
   - Implement consistent error handling across all API endpoints

2. **Search Feature Enhancements**
   - Add server-side search capabilities for better performance
   - Implement search history and recent searches
   - Add filters to narrow search results by type

3. **UI/UX Improvements**

4. **Additional Endpoints**
