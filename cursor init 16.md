# Cursor Init 16 - Document Upload Fix Implementation

## Summary of Actions Taken

This cursor initialization session focused on fixing a critical document upload issue in the Shigotoko Dashboard application. The error was occurring when attempting to upload documents, with the specific error message:

```
TypeError: Content-Type was not one of "multipart/form-data" or "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
    at async POST (app\api\documents\route.ts:108:21)
```

The issue was traced to the document upload implementation in the API client code and successfully fixed.

## Issues Identified

1. **Content-Type Header Conflict**
   - The document upload API in `lib/api.ts` was incorrectly handling the `Content-Type` header when sending FormData.
   - The empty `headers` object in the fetch request was causing issues with the automatic Content-Type header that browsers set for FormData.
   - The error originated at line 108 in `app/api/documents/route.ts` when trying to parse the form data.

2. **Data Serialization Issues**
   - The client code was incorrectly serializing array values (tags and sharedWith) using `JSON.stringify()`.
   - The server was expecting comma-separated values, not JSON strings.

3. **Inconsistent Empty Array Handling**
   - The code was appending empty arrays to the FormData object without proper checks.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Content-Type Header Handling**
   - Removed the custom headers object from the fetch request to allow the browser to automatically set the correct `multipart/form-data` Content-Type with boundary parameter.
   - Updated the comment to clearly document this behavior for future developers.

2. **Improved Array Value Serialization**
   - Changed array handling from `JSON.stringify()` to `join(',')` for proper serialization.
   - This matches the server-side parsing logic in `route.ts` which was using string splitting.

3. **Added Empty Array Validation**
   - Added explicit length checks for arrays before appending them to FormData.
   - This prevents unnecessary form fields for empty arrays.

## Technical Implementation

The fix was implemented in the `documentAPI.upload` method in `lib/api.ts`:

```typescript
// Upload a new document
upload: async (documentData: { 
  name: string; 
  file: File | string; // File object or data URL
  projectId?: string;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  sharedWith?: string[];
}) => {
  // For file uploads, we need to use FormData
  if (documentData.file instanceof File) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', documentData.file);
    formData.append('name', documentData.name);
    
    if (documentData.projectId) {
      formData.append('projectId', documentData.projectId);
    }
    
    if (documentData.description) {
      formData.append('description', documentData.description);
    }
    
    if (documentData.tags && documentData.tags.length > 0) {
      formData.append('tags', documentData.tags.join(','));
    }
    
    if (documentData.sharedWith && documentData.sharedWith.length > 0) {
      formData.append('sharedWith', documentData.sharedWith.join(','));
    }
    
    return fetchAPI('/documents', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
      // Do not set any Content-Type header, let browser set it automatically
    });
  } else {
    // For data URLs or other string representations
    return fetchAPI('/documents', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(documentData),
    });
  }
}
```

## Testing Outcomes

The document upload functionality now works correctly with the following improvements:

1. Files upload successfully without Content-Type errors
2. Array data (tags, sharedWith) is properly serialized and passed to the server
3. Empty arrays are handled gracefully with appropriate checks

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

1. **FormData and Content-Type**
   - When using FormData with fetch API, never manually set the Content-Type header
   - The browser needs to set this automatically with the proper boundary parameter
   
2. **API Consistency**
   - Ensure client-side data serialization matches server-side parsing expectations
   - Use consistent formats for data transmission (strings vs arrays vs objects)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always include try/catch blocks for network operations
   - Log detailed error information to aid in debugging
   - Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Enhanced File Upload Validation**
   - Add file type validation on the client before upload attempts
   - Implement file size restrictions to prevent overly large uploads
   - Add progress indicators for large file uploads

2. **Server-Side Improvements**
   - Add more detailed error messages in API responses
   - Implement better logging for debugging upload issues
   - Consider adding support for chunked uploads for large files

3. **Testing Implementation**
   - Add unit tests for document upload functionality
   - Create integration tests that validate the entire upload flow
   - Test various edge cases such as very large files, special characters in filenames, etc.

This fix ensures that the document upload functionality works reliably across the application, improving the overall user experience and stability of the Shigotoko Dashboard.
